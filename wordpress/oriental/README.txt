Hi,
Thank you for downloading the oriental green wordpress theme from jinsona.

This theme has a hidden extra sidebar which can be slide out by clicking the toggle button. Make changes in the "about me" field by changing the about.txt file.

The .psd file for the shield of the header can be downloaded from here.

There is an extra header image incuded in the theme pack for x-box fans. All you need to do to enable this header is to find

.top {
	height:190px;
	margin-top:0px;
	background:url(images/top.jpg);
	}

this line and change the"top.jpg" to "top2.jpg"

cheers
Jinsona
